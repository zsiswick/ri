  			<h1>Resources to Shine Your Business</h1>
  			<p class="big-p">Ruby Invoice was created by me, Zac Siswick. I'm a creative web designer and coder who found great joy as a freelancer, and helping people get started with their own businesses. So I've created a handy list of resources I found to be indespensable in my freelance work, these are services I couldn't live without!</p>

              <strong>site5</strong></a>: 98% of my personal websites, and the websites I have built for others, are hosted by site5. They have a great track record in terms of helpful and timely technical support, as well as competitive pricing. In terms of shared hosting, (and I've tried almost all the big names), theirs is the fastest and most reliable I have found.

              <strong>Don't Make Me Think</strong></a>: This book changed the way I thought about web design over night. It's a feather of a book, but it's jam packed with practical knowledge that anyone designing for the Web can learn from. Steve Krug has a case-study approach to teaching usability, his wry style might make you laugh out loud, but he'll also make you ask hard questions about your own web design as you examine real-life scenarios in each chapter.

              <strong>The Business of Design</strong></a>: As a freelance designer, I can honestly say that most of my client work fell into my lap. When opportunity calls, it's easy to overlook a lot of critical details around writing up a proper design brief, proposal, and a contract. But without these critical components, life can easily become difficult to manage several months into a big project. This book helped me reduce my stress level by getting organized and becoming more business-like in my approach to handling freelance work. I highly recommend this one.

              <strong>codeschool</strong></a>: Much of my coding skills have been self-taught, and I've found over the years the best way to learn code is to write it. Codeschool has a fantastic code editor that guides you through progressively more challenging excersizes, (dare I say it's somewhat addictive). After you've completed one of their "coding paths", you'll be well equipped to dive head-first into your next coding progject.

What's also great about Vitamin T is they offer competitive benefits to their talent, and they only specialize in design-focused jobs.
